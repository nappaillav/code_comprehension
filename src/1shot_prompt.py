Let's break down the execution of the provided Python script step by step.

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `similar_elements` is defined, which takes two parameters: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.

2. **Set Intersection**:
   - Inside the function, it converts both input tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) into sets. This removes any duplicate elements.
   - It then performs an intersection of the two sets using the `&` operator, which gives us the common elements between the two sets.

3. **Tuple Conversion**:
   - The result of the intersection (which is a set) is converted back into a tuple.

4. **Function Call**:
   - The function `similar_elements` is called with the two lists as arguments:
     - `test_tup1`: `[1, 2, 2, 70, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3]`
     - `test_tup2`: `[5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]`

5. **Execution of Function**:
   - `set(test_tup1)` results in `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 70}` (duplicates removed).
   - `set(test_tup2)` results in `{5, 6, 7, 8, 9}` (duplicates removed).
   - The intersection of these two sets is `{5}`, as `5` is the only common element.

6. **Return Value**:
   - This intersection `{5}` is converted to a tuple, resulting in `(5,)`.

7. **Printing the Result**:
   - The function returns the tuple `(5,)`, and this is printed.

### Predicted Output:
```python
(5,)
```
